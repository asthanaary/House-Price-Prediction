##  Overview
This project uses supervised learning algorithms to estimate house prices from features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc.  
The workflow includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **model training**, and **prediction**.

---

##  Features
- Clean & preprocess raw housing data
- Train multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate performance with **RMSE**, **MAE**, **RÂ²**
- Save trained models for later predictions
